# AI Writing Tells

Some ways that writing by AI can be identified:

## 1. **Repetitive Phrasing and Sentence Structure**

- AI writing can lack variability in sentence structure, leading to repetitive phrasing. For instance, many sentences might start with the same type of phrase ("Additionally," "Furthermore," "In conclusion").
- Key phrases may be echoed multiple times within a piece, reflecting how the AI emphasizes certain points without fully understanding context.

## 2. **Overly Formal or Generic Language**

- AI tends to adopt a somewhat stiff or formal tone, often lacking the nuances of natural human expression. This can make the writing sound slightly robotic or detached.
- The tone might also swing to the opposite extreme with models trained to be overly friendly or conversational, leading to casual phrasing that feels artificial.

## 3. **Superficial Content Depth**

- AI writing might cover a topic broadly without depth. It may touch on major points or provide a general overview but lacks insights, personal anecdotes, or profound analysis.
- The writing often lists points or ideas but might struggle with complex, nuanced perspectives or intricate storytelling.

## 4. **Awkward Transitions and Flow**

- Even the best AI can struggle to connect ideas seamlessly, resulting in awkward or abrupt transitions between paragraphs or topics. This can make the flow seem choppy or disjointed.
- AI writing might switch topics without adequate transition sentences or logical flow, leading to a "list-like" quality.

## 5. **Inconsistent or Misaligned Tone**

- AI can lose consistency in tone, especially in longer pieces. It might unintentionally shift from formal to informal or swap emotional tones mid-paragraph.
- Sometimes, AI responses may sound overly optimistic or neutral when discussing somber topics, giving away that it lacks a genuine emotional response.

## 6. **Overly Cautious Statements and Repeated Disclaimers**

- AI will sometimes hedge statements with phrases like "It’s important to note," "In general," or "Typically," especially in technical or sensitive topics. It’s a programmed caution that stands out when repeated often.
- Common disclaimers may appear, with phrases like "I'm not a professional," "This is a general overview," or similar qualifiers.

## 7. **Factual Errors or Misunderstandings of Context**

- AI-generated content can sometimes make factual errors or fail to understand the context of certain details. For instance, an AI might misinterpret pop culture references, local idioms, or specific historical events.
- In technical writing, the AI might misunderstand or simplify complex concepts, creating slightly inaccurate statements that stand out to experts in the field.

## 8. **Excessive Use of “Filler” Words and Phrases**

- AI may overuse filler phrases like "As we have seen," "In conclusion," or "In other words." These can be overly prominent in AI writing as the model works to reinforce its points or transition ideas.
- AI also tends to repeat phrases in slightly different forms to fill out text length, making the piece longer without adding new information.

## 9. **Lack of Personal Touch or Unique Voice**

- AI lacks personal anecdotes, stories, or opinions unless specifically instructed. It might sound like it's simply reporting or listing facts, rather than providing an original viewpoint.
- The voice may feel uniform and lack the quirks or idiosyncrasies that make human writing engaging. This absence of personality can make AI writing feel flat.

## 10. **Predictable Structures and Overuse of “Balanced” Sentences**

- AI tends to structure sentences and paragraphs in predictable ways, often with a balanced rhythm. Sentences might be of similar length and complexity, lacking variety.
- It often employs simple cause-and-effect structures without the complexity and spontaneity of human thought patterns, which can make it seem too predictable.

## 11. **Inability to Address Unusual Questions or Odd Requests**

- When presented with an unexpected or creative prompt, AI often responds with a generalized answer or deflects the question if it doesn’t have enough context. Humans are more likely to attempt a creative or humorous response.
