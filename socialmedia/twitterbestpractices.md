## 2\. Create a complete Twitter profile

Best practices for Twitter work well with a complete profile. Ensure that your Twitter profile is complete and up-to-date, with a strong bio, profile photo, and cover image.

## 4\. Keep your tweets concise

Twitter is all about brevity, so make sure your messages are clear and to the point. Ensure that you use strong verbs and avoid using too many hashtags or @mentions, making your tweets difficult to read. No one wants to wade through a long, rambling tweet, so keep it short and sweet. For example, here’s a tweet from Charmin promoting their brand at the SXSW event.

## 5\. Use relevant keywords

Using relevant keywords are another best practices for Twitter. Similar to any other form of marketing, it’s essential to use relevant keywords in your tweets. Use keywords that describe your business or product, and make sure you’re using them naturally and interestingly. Don’t stuff your tweets with keywords – instead, focus on creating quality content that will appeal to your target audience.

## 6\. Use hashtags

Hashtags are a great way to reach a wider audience and promote your [brand on Twitter](https://bulk.ly/twitter-branding/). Ensure that you use relevant hashtags in your tweets, and search for popular hashtags in your industry to see what others are saying. Hashtags are an excellent way to reach a wider audience, but using too many can make your tweets look spammy. Choose a few relevant hashtags and use them sparingly.

## 7\. Pay attention to the tone of your tweets

The tone of your tweets should match the tone of your brand. If you’re a serious business, your tweets should reflect that. On the other hand, your tweets should be lighthearted and playful if you’re a fun and quirky brand. Please [ensure that your tone of voice is consistent](https://bulk.ly/how-to-create-a-social-media-style-guide/) across your tweets. For example, Wendy’s is a brand that’s famous for roasts and witty tweets.

As you create content for Twitter, be mindful of making it inclusive. Avoid using sexist, racist, or homophobic language, and think about how people from different backgrounds might interpret your tweets. By creating an inclusive environment on Twitter, you’ll attract more followers and build a stronger brand.

It’s easy to get caught up in the moment and tweet something you may later regret. Avoid tweeting anything controversial, offensive, or inflammatory. We all make mistakes, but thinking before you tweet is essential. Once something is out there, you can’t take it back. Stick to positive topics that help [promote your brand](https://www.yoreoyster.com/blog/virtual-business-address/) in a positive light.

## 8\. Engage with other users and build a relevant following

One of the popular best practices for Twitter is user engagement. Twitter is an excellent platform for [engaging with customers](https://bulk.ly/customer-engagement-marketing/ "engaging with customers") and other businesses in your industry. Follow other users, retweet interesting content, and join in on conversations. Respond to tweets, even if they’re negative. It’s essential to engage with your audience, even if they’re not singing your praises. Showing that you’re responsive and open to feedback will go a long way. Use a [poll](https://bulk.ly/instagram-poll-questions/) maker to get useful feedback from your followers.

It’s not all about the numbers, but a relevant following can do wonders for your business. To build a relevant following, start by finding and following people in your industry. Many of these people will follow you back, and you’ll quickly build up a list of relevant, engaged followers. By building a relevant following, you can create a community of people interested in what you have to say.

## 9\. Plan for customer support

Customers often reach out to businesses on Twitter for customer support. If you’re not prepared to handle [customer service](https://bulk.ly/social-media-customer-service/) inquiries, you could do more harm than good. If a customer is rude or uncooperative, it’s best to take the high road and avoid getting into a Twitter fight. Ofcourse, you should stand up for yourself if someone is blatantly attacking you or your business.

Ensure that you have a proper plan in place to handle customer support issues that arise on Twitter.

No one wants to think about a crisis, but it’s essential to be prepared if something goes wrong.

In a crisis, it’s essential to be transparent and honest. Customers will appreciate your candor and will be more likely to forgive you if you’re open and honest about what’s going on. We have repeatedly seen that being transparent goes a long way, especially in the age of social media. By having a plan to handle crises, you can avoid making a bad situation worse.

## 11\. Take advantage of rich media

Leveraging rich media is another Twitter best practice. Tweets with images, videos, or other forms of rich media tend to perform better than those without.

Your visuals should [align with your brand](https://www.superside.com/blog/creating-a-visual-identity) and be tailored to the Twitter platform. This will help you stand out from the competition and get more engagement on your tweets.

You can also use live video to connect with your followers in real-time. Video is a great way to show off your products, give a behind-the-scenes look at your business, or just have some fun with your followers. There are endless possibilities for using rich media in your tweets, so get creative and experiment with the media that works best for you and your audience.

## 12\. Use Twitter analytics

Twitter provides a wealth of data about your tweets and your audience. Some metrics you can track include impressions, engagement, and [click-through rate](https://bulk.ly/social-media-terms/click-through-rate-ctr/). Use this data to see what’s working well and what could be improved.

For example, if you notice that a specific type of tweet performs remarkably well, try to replicate that success in future tweets. On the other hand, if you see that a particular type of tweet isn’t getting much engagement, you may want to avoid that in the future.

Use this data to see what’s working and what isn’t, and adjust your strategy accordingly. By understanding your [Twitter analytics](https://bulk.ly/twitter-analytics-tools/), you can fine-tune your content and ensure that your tweets reach the right people.

## 13\. Keep an eye on the competition

Another Twitter best practice is to keep an eye on what your competition is doing on Twitter. See what kind of content they’re sharing, how often they’re tweeting, and who their followers are.

You can also use Twitter’s advanced search features to [find tweets](https://bulk.ly/how-to-search-someones-tweets/ "find tweets") that mention your competitor’s product or service. This is an excellent way to see what people are saying about them and get some ideas for your own content.

## 14\. Watch out for trends

Engaging on Twitter is all about being timely and relevant, so it’s essential to watch the latest trends. By understanding what’s happening in the world, you can ensure that your tweets are relevant and interesting to your audience.

See what’s trending in your industry and find ways to join the conversation. You can also use Twitter’s search function to find specific keywords and hashtags. This is an excellent way to see what people say about your brand, product, or service.

You can also use trends to your advantage by piggybacking on popular hashtags or topics. Just be sure not to overdo it – too much self-promotion will turn off your followers. Instead, focus on adding value to the conversation, and you’ll be sure to get noticed.

## 15\. Don’t be afraid to experiment

One of the best practices for Twitter is the ability to experiment. Twitter is a great place to experiment with new content and strategies. Because it’s such a fast-paced platform, you can quickly see what works and what doesn’t. So if you’re feeling stuck, don’t be afraid to try something new.

This could mean anything from changing your [content strategy](https://bulk.ly/social-media-content-strategy/) to trying out a new tool. The important thing is to keep an open mind and be willing to experiment. Twitter is constantly evolving, so it’s essential to stay flexible and adaptable.

## 16\. Engage in social listening

[Social listening](https://bulk.ly/social-listening/) is the process of monitoring social media for mentions of your brand, product, or industry. It is an excellent way to see what people are saying about you and your business, and it can also help you identify potential customers or leads.

You can also use a social listening tool like Hootsuite Insights to see what’s being said about your brand across the web. Use social listening to your advantage, and you’ll be sure to get more out of your Twitter presence.
