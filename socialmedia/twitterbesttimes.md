X (formerly known as Twitter) has consistently been the platform for up-to-the-minute conversations and breaking news. And that didn’t stop X from being part of the news itself on the network last year. Businesses and brands continuously look to X to participate in trending topics that align with their [brand values](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/brand-values/) in the process. However, due to global conflicts and vocal executives, some brands have limited their social strategies around X.

Despite all this, X peak times for engagement extended slightly compared to last year, with hours extending further into the weekday afternoons. The best times to post on Twitter are Mondays through Fridays beginning at 9 a.m. and extending until nearly 3 p.m.

This extension of engagement on X could reflect an interest in developing news and updates as the day unfolds, as well as a desire for entertainment. There were also several global events that kept users engaged on the app last year. Brands also use X as part of their [customer service strategy](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/twitter-customer-service/), as an alternative to traditional customer support options.
