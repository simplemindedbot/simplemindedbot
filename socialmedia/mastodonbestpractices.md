# Mastodon Best Practices

1. Content Curation: Focus on creating high-quality, engaging content that resonates with your audience. Mastodon’s community values niche topics and transparency, so prioritize authenticity and customer-centricity.

2. Hashtags: Use relevant hashtags to reach a wider audience and make your posts discoverable. However, avoid overusing them, as Mastodon’s algorithm prioritizes quality over quantity.

3. Engage with Communities: Mastodon is all about community-driven conversations. Participate in discussions, respond to comments, and engage with other users to build relationships and grow your following.

4. Visual Content: Use high-quality images, videos, and GIFs to make your posts stand out. However, ensure they’re optimized for Mastodon’s file size limits and compression.

5. Follow Recommendations: Take advantage of Mastodon’s new carousel feature, which suggests follow recommendations above the first post older than four hours on your home feed. This helps you discover new accounts and grow your network.

6. Website Embeds: Use Mastodon’s improved website embeds to share your content on your own website or blog. This enhances the user experience and drives engagement.

7. Monitor and Adjust: Keep an eye on your analytics and adjust your posting strategy accordingly. Experiment with different content types, hashtags, and timing to optimize your results.
