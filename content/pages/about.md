I'm Scot Campbell, and I've spent over two decades navigating the intersections of technology, strategy, and business. As a seasoned Solution Consultant and Agile practitioner, I'm driven by a passion for blending technical insights with real-world business solutions.

My professional journey has led me to explore a wide range of domains, from project management and data analytics to cutting-edge AI applications. I've worked with organizations to optimize operations, bridge gaps between technical and business teams, and implement systems that make a tangible impact on efficiency and innovation.

Here, I share my experiences and insights on harnessing the power of AI, software development methodologies, and the evolving landscape of technology. Simpleminded Robot is a space for thought-provoking articles, tutorials, and explorations on topics that matter to today's technology professionals.

Whether you're looking to explore the potential of generative AI, streamline your project management techniques, or stay ahead in an ever-changing digital world, I aim to provide content that resonates with curious minds and tech enthusiasts alike.
